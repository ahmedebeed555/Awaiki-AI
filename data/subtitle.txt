I have here
a pendulum
I have an object that weighs 15
kilograms and I can lift it up one meter
which I have done now that means I've
done work
MGH is the work I have done believe me
I've increased the potential energy of
this object
15 times 10 it's about 150 joules
if I let it fall
then that will be converted to kinetic
energy
if I would let it swing
from one meter height and you would be
there and it would hit you you'd be dead
150 joules is enough to kill you
they use these devices they're called a
wreckable
they use them to demolish buildings
you lift up a very heavy object even
heavier than this and then you let it go
you swing it thereby converting
gravitational potential energy into
kinetic energy and that way you can
demolish a building you just let it hit
and it breaks a building and that's the
whole idea of wrecking
so you are using then the conversion of
gravitational potential energy to
kinetic energy
now I am such a strong believer of the
conservation of mechanical energy
that I am willing
to put my life on the line
if I release
that Bob
from a certain height
then that Bob can never come back to a
point where the height is any larger
if I release it from this height
and it swings
then when it reaches here it could not
be higher there is a conversion from
gravitational potential energy to
kinetic energy back to gravitational
potential energy and it will come to
stop here and when it swings back it
should not be able to reach any higher
provided
that I do not give this object an
initial speed when I stand here
I trust
the conservation of chemical energy for
100 percent
I may not trust myself
I'm going to release this object
and I hope I will be able to do it at
zero speed
so that when it comes back it may touch
my chin but it may not Crush my chin
I want you to be extremely quiet because
this is no joke
if I don't succeed in giving it zero
speed then this will be my last lecture
I will close my eyes I don't want to see
this
so please be very quiet
I almost didn't sleep all night
three two one zero
physics works and I'm still alive
