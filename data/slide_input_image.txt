{"prompt": "Create a portfolio project in Python that focuses on data analysis. You will be given a dataset of your choice and your task is to analyze the data and present your findings in a clear and concise manner. Make sure to include data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis in your project. Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis. Your final deliverable should be a Jupyter notebook with your code, visualizations, and explanations."}
{"prompt": "In this data analysis portfolio project, you will be working with the YouTube API to extract and analyze data from YouTube videos using Python. You will learn how to authenticate and interact with the YouTube API, retrieve video-specific information, analyze video metrics such as views, likes, and comments, and visualize the data using popular Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of how to use the YouTube API for data analysis purposes and be able to showcase your skills in a portfolio."}
